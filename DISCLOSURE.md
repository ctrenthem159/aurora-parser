# ðŸ¤– AI Assistance Disclosure

Portions of this project's source code were written with the assistance of ChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI.

ChatGPT has been used as a coding assistant to help:

- Refactor and structure Python code
- Write test cases using pytest, pytest-mock, and pytest-cov
- Implement logging, error handling, and CLI parsing
- Explain tools, libraries, and testing concepts
- Write and format documentation, including this disclosure notice.

In addition, GitHub CoPilot has been used in the following ways:

- Providing in-app code completions in VS Code

All design decisions, feature definitions, and project goals were created independently.
AI assistance was not used to generate new features or original ideas, but to improve code clarity, maintainability, and development speed.

All code has been reviewed, validated, tested, and usually modified by a human before being committed.
