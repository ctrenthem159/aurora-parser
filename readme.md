# Aurora Parser

A simple interactive tool to extract your empire's logs from the Aurora database and export them to a variety of formats to use downstream. The tool was originally built to pull game logs as a .csv file to hand off to ChatGPT for creating narratives, but it can be used for a wide variety of uses.

## üöÄ Features

- Interactive menu to select your save and empire. (It will show you all empires, including NPRs and Precursors)
- Export logs to csv, json, excel, human-readable text, and html

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

For now, you have to clone the repo and install the requirements manually. A functional installer is coming later.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ctrenthem159/aurora-parser
cd aurora-parser
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üì¶ Usage

```bash
python [--format csv] [--log-level INFO] [--log_file output.log] src/main.py path/to/AuroraDB.db path/to/output.file
```

### Arguments

- `--format`: choose the output file format. Options are csv, json, xlsx (excel spreadsheet), txt (human-readable text file), or html
- `--log-level`: set the logging level. All standard log levels are available
- `--log-file`: output the log to a file. Be sure to include this when opening a support ticket.

All of these arguments are optional. The format defaults to a csv file and logging defaults to `INFO` and logs directly to stdout.

## üß™ Testing

This project uses pytest for testing, just run `pytest` to run tests.

To run with coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=src tests/
coverage report
coverage html  # view HTML report in `htmlcov/index.html
```

Currently, tests cover the db functions only but the rest is in progress.

## üî≠ Roadmap

- [x] Multi-format export
- [/] Pytest coverage and logging
- [ ] GUI interface (PyQt)
- [ ] Conversion to a live viewer in addition to exporting logs
- [ ] Viewer for other database areas that users find relevant. (Unless Steve says otherwise, this tool will not allow modifying the database)

## ü§ñ AI Assistance Disclosure

Portions of this project's source code were written with the assistance of ChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI.

ChatGPT has been used as a coding assistant to help:

- Refactor and structure Python code
- Write test cases using pytest, pytest-mock, and pytest-cov
- Implement logging, error handling, and CLI parsing
- Explain tools, libraries, and testing concepts

All design decisions, feature definitions, and project goals were created independently.
AI assistance was not used to generate new features or original ideas, but to improve code clarity, maintainability, and development speed.

All code has been reviewed, validated,, tested, and usually modified by a human before being committed.
