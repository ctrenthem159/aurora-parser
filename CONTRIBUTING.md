# Contributing to Aurora Parser

This project welcomes all contributors that seek to improve the aurora log parser, no matter the size or substance. While we would love to have you work on the project, please note some basic rules before getting started.

## How can I contribute?

- Report bugs or feature requests by submitting an [Issue Ticket](https://github.com/ctrenthem159/aurora-parser/issues/new)
- Submit pull requests with code or documentation changes. This includes adding new features, improving or adding missing documentation, or providing a fix to an existing bug. If you are submitting a bugfix, you do not need to submit an issue before opening a PR.
- Review open PRs and provide comments or advice to the requestor.
- Provide feedback or suggestions.

## Getting Started

All contributions should start like most other projects by *forking* the project on GitHub, *cloning* your forked copy, and making changes there. Once your contribution is complete, open a PR on this project with your changes.

To set up the environment, either use `pip install -r requirements.txt` or simply `poetry install` if you use poetry.

Prior to submitting a PR, be sure to run the test suite and all tests pass. If you are submitting new functionality, please include tests to cover it. This project uses `pytest-cov` to generate coverage reports, so use it to ensure you didn't miss anything.

## Coding & Writing Standards

Standards should be pretty straightforward. Review existing code to get an idea of variable/function naming conventions, formatting expectations, etc. Your code should conform to the existing conventions as much as possible, but it's not required.

When writing PRs, issues, or documentation please use proper English and full sentences. For the most part, just act like an adult.
